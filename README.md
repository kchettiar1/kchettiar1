ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Krishnan Chettiar.
  
Iâ€™m interested in designing user interfaces and coding digital experiences. 

Iâ€™m currently working my way through HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Going forward I will be looking at designing and creating components/modules that contribute to web applications. Whether that is in FinTech, Edtech or something else, is TBD. 

You can connect with me  on twitter @kchettiar1.

Have a good one and happy coding.

KC
