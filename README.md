ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Krishnan Chettiar.
  
Iâ€™m interested in designing user interfaces and coding digital experiences. 

Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS and will be looking designing and creating components/modules that contribute to web application. Whether that is in FinTech, Edtech or something else - I will decide as I progress through my learning. 

For now though I am working on designing and building out my Portfolio site. You can hit up on twitter @kchettiar1 in the meantime.

Have a good one and happy coding.

KC
